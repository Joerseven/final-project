REQUIRMENTS
====

To use this software you must have a recent version of chrome, and you need to load it in as an 'unpacked extension' (you must be in developer mode).
You'll need to have at least one Gmail account to test the product, two if you want to practise sending messages between two accounts. You can always send messages to your own account,
however and test that way. I'd recommend two devices or the keys get a little confusing.

Just load in the /dist folder, that's the folder that's been built and is ready. If you want to read the code then look in the src folder, that's what it looked like before I bundled it.


Here are two videos showcasing the product, both of them demos that I carried out using two of my machines. One was a mac and one was a windows and the plugin worked on both,
hopefully there aren't any compatibility issues.

Video one is about a minute long and video two is about two minutes long. 


Thanks for reading
